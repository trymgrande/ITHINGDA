IR is characterized by finding unstructured data, usually text, while data retreival is executed on structured data (like databases). Finn is an IR system because the data stored is unstructured. It is therefore hard to categorize all the different listings. As a result, the search engine looks for similarities between the query and the documents instead of being able to retreive documents by using tons of filters.

The boolean model has the weakness of limited weights, which can lead to a lower accuracy. It is also not memory optimized. The probability model has the disadvantage of requiring extra user input, which is not going to be very user friendly. This leads us to choosing the vector space model, which is an improvement of the boolean model and does not have the disadvantage of the probability model. In addition, it allows for partial matching between documents, that allow for a higher degree of ranking. While using this model, we can implement inverse document frequency for weighing terms (tf-idf). This allows for weights that are normalized to the language. In addition, we can use length normalization, to avoid a higher skewed weight for longer documents.

Image retreival can be done using text retrieval by converting the image to text. Specifically, we can convert it to a binary string. This way, it will be similar to how boolean retreival works, the only difference being that terms are replaced by pixels. Then, we can apply the bitwise AND operator to find the similarity between images. This assumes the format (resolution) is the same in both/all images. The result will be a new bitstring where the similarity degree is defined by the relationship of 1's to 0's. Meaning that many 1's translates to similar images. 

## 2
Histogram as a feature has the challenge of a very broad spectrum of values (3 x 0-255 colors). Because of this, there will be a very small likelyhood of finding identically matching pixels betweeen images. To combat this, one could implement either a descretization or a vectorization in order to increase this likelyhood, making it easier to compare images.
Also, the histogram does not describe the semantics of the image.

### c
Mismatch caused by different image formats, e.g. resolution. If one image is the same, but twice the resolution, this method will fail.

Hash strings are not easily compressable as they are relatively random compared to words in a language. Therefore, it is not efficient to use this method.
