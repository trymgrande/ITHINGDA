## a
initial state: s
states: {s,b,c,h,g}
actions: {actions(s)={go(c),go(b)}...}
path_cost: sum of cost of individual actions for a given path, e.g.: path s-c-g costs 3+5=8
transition_model: returns resulting state given a state and an action, e.g. result(in(s);go(b)) => in(b)
goal test: in(g)

## b
assuming alphabetic ordering of nodes for tie-breaking.

expanded:   frontier(g,h,f):
S           C(3,1,4),B(1,4,5)
C           B(1,4,5),g(8,0,8),h(4,1,5)
b           g(8,0,8),h(4,1,5)
h           g(4,0,4)
g           

## c
path found: schg
could make h(c) >= 5 to make sure h is not shorter than actual remaining path.

## d
## e
### a
no pruning occurs

### b
the current one, but backwards

## f
expanded:   frontier:
s           a(s),c(s),b(s)
a           c(s),b(s)
b           c(s),e(s,b),d(s,b)
c           e(s,b),d(s,b)
d           e(s,b),**g(s,b,d)**


path found: sbdg
not optimal since edge costs are not equal

# 2 - logic
## e
<!-- - Validity:  If a term is valid it is a tauntology => always true
- Satisfyability: If a term is satisfiable it is sometimes true  -->

a: satisfyable
b: neither
c: valid
d: valid
e: satisfyable
f: satisfyable
g: valid

# 4 - planning
## a
1. cannot go from start directly to paint (goes for both a and b)
2. b is never sanded before painting it
3. cannot go to finish without being painted
4. cannot go to finish without being puton

## c
sand(a) or sand(b);paint(a) or paint(b);on(a,b)

# 5 - game theory
## 2
### a
all except b,b since then a,a is an obviously better choice

### b
can eliminate agent2(b) since it is dominated
can eliminate agent1(b) since it is dominated
strategy is then (a,a)

## 3
a2(s) eliminated because it is strictly dominated by a2(r)
a1(a), a1(b) eliminated because they are strictly dominated by a1(c)
a2(r) eliminated as it is strictly dominated by a2(t)
result is (c,t)
