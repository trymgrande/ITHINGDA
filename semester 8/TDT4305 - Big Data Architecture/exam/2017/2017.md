## a
shingles are a form of decomposing and re-combining words in different ways in order to try to find which items are similar to each other. A common way of doing this is by using k-shingling where a number k is selected, and used to construct all combinations of words in a document of k letters.

## a
ask continously "how many messages have mentioned "sony a9" so far?" and report the new sum whenever it gets mentioned in the stream.

## b
- the 3 Vs
    - volume
        - high total number of images posted
    - velocity
        - many new images posted every second
    - variety
        - very different images posted

## c
This task can be translated to bit counting by setting a window with size N messages. The messages containing "sony a9" will be assigned a bit value 1, otherwise 0. This will then replace the original stream. This new stream will be indexed using bucketing, allowing for fast bit counting.

## d
The bit stream coming in will be clicks representing 1 if an item was purchased, and 0 if it was not. The window will have a calculated fraction of N/1's, where N represents the window size, and the 1's are counted like this:


Updating:
Whenever a new bit (click) is added, the fraction will change by adding N/(i-j).

## f
for odd: start from very right index with 1=odd
for even: start from right index + 1 with 2=even
bit of hashed value from left starting with 0
