Four of the main components are Numbus, zookeeper, supervisor, worker, communicating bidirectionally in the respective order (see image). This is a master-slave model where processes are coordinated through the zookeeper. 
The numbus is the master node that distributes application code across worker nodes. It is a stateless single node that allows it to fail-fast by restarting without recovery, and its purpuse is to manage a cluster of zookeepers. 
The zookeeper is responsible for coordinating between the numbus and the supervisors. It also stores all their data in order to make them fail-fast.
The supervisor nodes manage the worker nodes by running the worker nodes as daemons. It is responsible for creating, starting, stopping worker processes to execute assigned tasks. It is also fail-fast by storing data in the zookeeper.
The workers are the processes themselves and are assigned tasks by their supervisor.
