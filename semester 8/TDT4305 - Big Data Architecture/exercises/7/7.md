<!-- Given the following utility matrix, predict user 3â€™s rating of movie 1. -->
### a
1-1
m1=(1+2+2+3)/4=2
r1=[1-2,2-2,0,2-2,3-2]=[-1,0,0,0,1]
cos(r1,r1)=cos([-1,0,0,1],[-1,0,0,1])=1

1-2
m2=(3+3)/2=3
r2=[0,3-3,3-3,0]=[0,0,0,0,0]
cos(r1,r2)=undefined

1-3
m3=(1+3+5)/3=3
r3=[0,1-3,3-3,5-3]=[0,-2,0,2,0]
cos(r1,r3)=0.0

1-4
m4=(5+3+2+2)/4=3
r4=[5-3,3-3,2-3,0,2-3]=[2,0,-1,0,-1]
cos(r1,r4)=-0.87

### b
N = {m3,m4}
predict by weighted average:
(rating1*w1+rating2*w2)/(w1+w2)
(3*0+2*-0.87)/(0-0.87)=2
