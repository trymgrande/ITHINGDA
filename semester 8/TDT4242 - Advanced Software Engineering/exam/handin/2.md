**Scalability test**

<!-- Used to find out how the system will be able to scale out by checking the maximum load per server in order to identifying how many servers will be needed for a given load. -->

The purpose of scalability testing is to test how well the system can be scaled up to process the 
increased workload. 

**Stress test**
The purpose of stress testing is to test how well the system can perform acceptably under 
worse-case condition. The system is deliberately stressed by pushing it to and beyond its 
specific limits for a while in order to identify some bugs related to memory, e.g. memory leaks. Knowing the worst case here can be hard as one would have to predict the future interest of a given event.

**Load and stability test**
These tests are developed in order to make sure the system will perform over time. This is especially important with services that need 24/7 uptime, e.g. cloud services. The results from this can often show how often the system should be restarted, even if the specific problems are not found.


<!-- Stability entails how much uptime is needed throughout time, e.g. 24/7, may be needed with cloud services. Apache jmeter is used for load testing by ddosing ramping up until breaking point (same as stress?).


We must develop tests to make sure that the system will perform close to as well on day 1 as on day 250. These tests will find maintenance related issues before they arise in production. Even if the issues found during these tests cannot be solved, we can still figure out ways of working around them. For instance if we know that the system will perform worse after 125 days, without knowing the cause, we can instruct production to restart the system after a given time.  -->

**User acceptance test**
These tests are performed by users to see if their needs are met. This involves making sure that the functionality is as they expect and they understand how to use the system. This is not, however, based on requirements specifically, as that would be *requirement testing*. Rather, it tries to find out if the *functions* are correct according to the user.

**Operational acceptance test**
Operational acceptance testing is to make sure the system is ready to operate. This involves:
- Making sure there are backup facilities in case of irrecoverable incidents.
- Procedures for disaster recovery, e.g. an overload occurs.
- Training or manual for end-users to make sure they can easily learn the system and look up any difficulties they may have.
- Security procedures, meaning what to do if any part of the system has been compromised.

## scalability test:

Used to find out how the system will be able to scale out by checking the maximum load per server in order to identifying how many servers will be needed for a given load.

- identify how system can scale
- check load per server in order to calculate how many servers will be needed 

## stress test:
Used to identify the potential maximum load for cases like black friday. Can be tested using e.g. apache jmeter. Predicting the actual stress will be hard to determine since the actual interest is not fully known, especially with new event variants.

 - max load e.g. black friday
- knowing worst case is hard 


## load and stability test:
Stability entails how much uptime is needed throughout time, e.g. 24/7, may be needed with cloud services. Apache jmeter is used for load testing by ddosing ramping up until breaking point (same as stress?).

- 24/7 stable service e.g. cloud
- apache jmeter is used for load testing by ddosing

_Scalability test_

We must make sure that the system can scale with the number of users. This means that the system remains usable when for example 100 000 users use the system. Issues related to scaling is hard for a developer to find without defined tests. The consequence of failing scalability requirements may be in worst case that the system will not work when deployed at voting booths.

_Stress test_

In order to ensure that the system we develop can handle the load required at voting days, we must develop tests which can determine whether the system remains operational with multiple concurrent users. Without this test in place we risk the system failing under maximum load.

_Load and stability test_

We must develop tests to make sure that the system will perform close to as well on day 1 as on day 250. These tests will find maintenance related issues before they arise in production. Even if the issues found during these tests cannot be solved, we can still figure out ways of working around them. For instance if we know that the system will perform worse after 125 days, without knowing the cause, we can instruct production to restart the system after a given time. 

_User acceptance test_

It is vital that we make sure that regular users understand how to use the system. By performing user acceptance tests we can catch design issues before they are implemented in production on voting day.

_Operational acceptance test_

Usually the team operating the system is not the same people who have developed the system. We must therefore produce adequate documentation so that the production team knows what to do if something goes wrong, regular maintenance tasks, training manual, security procedures etc.

**Scalability test**
To perform scalability testing, the testers can gradually increase the 
workload to the system, and also add more servers and workload managers, in order to 
measure how well the system can process the increased workload through adding more servers. 

**Stress test**
Apache jmeter can be used for stress testing by ramping up the number of virtual "users" until a breaking point is found. This is works essentially like a DDOS (Distributed Denial Of Service) attack, except the number of connections is slowly ramped up instead of all at once.

**Load and stability test**
These tests can inform about issues where the cause may or may not be known, by measuring how long time has passed and/or how loaded the system was over the given time. 


**User acceptance test**
A user acceptance test would be performed simply by handing the system with a user interface over to the end user. He would then explore the different parts of the system and evaluate it based on how he expects the functionality to work.

**Operational acceptance test**
This can be tested by allowing testers to intentionally breaking the system in the mentioned relevant ways, and then seeing how well the developers and maintaners are able to recover using the procedures.
