## scalability test:
Used to find out how the system will be able to scale out by checking the maximum load per server in order to identifying how many servers will be needed for a given load.
<!-- 
- identify how system can scale
- check load per server in order to calculate how many servers will be needed -->

## stress test:
Used to identify the potential maximum load for cases like black friday. Can be tested using e.g. apache jmeter. Predicting the actual stress will be hard to determine since the actual interest is not fully known, especially with new event variants.

<!-- - max load e.g. black friday
- knowing worst case is hard -->


## load and stability test:
Stability entails how much uptime is needed throughout time, e.g. 24/7, may be needed with cloud services. Apache jmeter is used for load testing by ddosing ramping up until breaking point (same as stress?).
<!-- 
- 24/7 stable service e.g. cloud
- apache jmeter is used for load testing by ddosing -->

## user acceptance testing:
tests performed by user to see if needs are met. Functional/acceptance/customer test terms used interchangeabily in agile development.
- Is the system ready to operate? 
- Tests against contracts and regulations by using checklists
- apha testing done at developers' sites by internal staff before customer release
- beta testing done at customers' sites before further customer release


    <!-- - user testing to see if needs are met
    - typical forms of acceptance testing
        - user
            - performed by end user
            - not based on requirements, as that would be requirement testing
        - operational 
            - ready to operate?
        - contract and regulation
            - test against standards using checklists
        - alpha and beta (or field)
            - alpha
                - developers' sites by internal staff before customer release
            - beta
                - field testing at customers' sites before full customer release
    - testing in agile
        - functional/acceptance/customer test terms used interchangeably
        - referring to user stories -->

before
let workoutData = await retrieveWorkoutImages(id); 
after
await retrieveWorkoutImages(id);

Purpose: remove unused variable.
