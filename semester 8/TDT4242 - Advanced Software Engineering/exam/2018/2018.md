Prioritizing using cumulative voting means that the stakeholders will vote in a prioritized manner for each requirement in order of importance. Each requirement will then be prioritized proportionally to the number of votes. This approach is beneficial as it accurately mirrors the interest of the stakeholders. Limitations of this is that the stakeholders might not know better than the developers what the most beneficial requirements are. The customers often do not know what they actually want.

Instructions:
Please read through the following questions in order to be able to test the requirements.

Questions:
- Are the requirements non-ambiguous, consistent, and without forward referencing, opacity, and noise?
- are the requirements grammatically correct?
- are the requirements sufficiently separated?

# 3 - Explain the following three DevOps terms: lead time, cycle time, and percentage complete and accurate
- The lead time for changes is essentially how long it takes a team to go from code committed to code successfully running in production. 
- Cycle time measures the time it takes for your team to complete work items once they begin actively working on them.
- Percent Complete & Accurate refers to the percent of time units are received in finished and correct form according to the requirements of the customer of the process.

# 4 - Explain what the firewall approach of regression test selection is, and explain how to determine the firewall of object-oriented systems.  
- identify classes changed
- identify descendants of changed classes
- identify classes that communicate with changed class
- this means that components surrounding a changed component are checked

Model-based testing is an application of model-based design for designing and optionally also executing artifacts to perform software testing or system testing. Models can be used to represent the desired behavior of a system under test (SUT), or to represent testing strategies and a test environment.

<!-- Explain characteristics, success factors, and challenges of an application-centric software Ecosystem, and list two examples and explain the examples briefly. -->
**characteristics**:
Complexity - In a platform ecosystem with numerous actors, complexity must be 
controlled somehow to reduce risk of gridlocks, unpredictable ripple effects and 
co-innovation problems
❑ Productivity - A network's ability to consistently transform technology and other 
raw materials of innovation into lower costs and new products. Simple to 
measure: return on invested capital.
❑ Robustness - Should be capable of surviving disruptions such as unforeseen 
technological change. 
❑ Niche creation - the ecosystem's capacity to increase meaningful diversity 
through the creation of valuable new functions or niches.
Strategy as Ecology, Marco Iansiti and Roy Levien. Harvard Business Review, March 2004. 

**success factors**
❑ A stable and sustainable platform and mechanism to govern the 
platform
❑ Developers, software firms making benefits from collective 
innovation
❑ Consumers receive high quality services/ products, 
opportunities for value co-creation
- Sustainability is the key!

How:
❑ Sustainability is the key!
❑ A viable business model
❑ A well-organized inter-organizational 
interaction model
❑ A paradigm supporting Collaboration
❑ A mechanism to allow Coopetition


**challenges**
• Little or no operating history
• Limited resources
• Multiple influences
• Dynamic technologies and markets
• Scalable business model
• Software in value proposition
• Innovation focus
• Lack of resources
• High uncertainty 
• Time-pressure
• Highly reactive 
• Rapidly evolving
• Temporary organizational state
• Little/ no history of stable operations
• Product development and business development in parallel
• Seek for product-market fit
• Strong presence of entrepreneurial personalities
