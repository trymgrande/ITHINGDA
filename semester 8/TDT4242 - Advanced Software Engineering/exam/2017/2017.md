## Req1: The robot is switched on and off with a button on the instrument panel.  
- ambiguous - does not specify which button
- specify instrument panel
## Req2: When the robot identifies that the snow on the ground around itself reaches a certain depth, the robot should automatically start and move to clear the snow. 
- ambiguous - does not specify where to move, when to stop, and what to do when stopping (e.g. parking)
- opacity - does not specify how snow level is detected

## Req3: When the user presses the remote-control key, the user can take over and have a full control of the robot to be able to move it forward, move it backward, make it turn left, and make it turn right. However, the robot can still make its own decision to move or not. 
- ambiguous - not clear when the robot decides to move or not
- inconsistent - the user cannot have "full control" if the robot still makes its own decisions to move

## Req4: When the air temperature is below 0 degree Celsius, the robot should automatically go to the charge site to charge its battery.   
- inconsistency: the robot cannot shuffle snow while also charging


## Req5: The robot should be able to identify obstacles and avoid collision with the obstacles. 
- opacity: does not specify how to identify obstacles

## Req6: The robot should be able to turn to a safe mode when it is in an unsafe environment. 
- ambigous: unspecified what is classified as an unsafe environment, and what the "safe mode" is

## Req7: The robot should maintain a safe speed when clearing the snow. 
- ambiguous: undefined "safe speed"

## Req8. The robot should be able to blink the light to another snow clearing robot to say hello when they meet.
- opacity: undefined how to detect the other robot

node 2 in f1 is affected, and we need to evaluate all previous traces leading up to it

t1 will traverse from M to f2, but not f1 at all
t2 will traverse from M to f2, but not f1 at all
t3 will traverse from M to f1 and into node 2
t3 will traverse from M to f1 and into node 2

t3 and t4 will be selected
